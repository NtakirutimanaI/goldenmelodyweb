      <p>Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as the only source of our beliefs. We consider our movement to be the result of the Protestant conviction Sola Scriptura—the Bible as the only standard of faith and practice for Christians.

        <p>28 Fundamental Beliefs
The Holy Scriptures Z1
The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired authors
spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to humanity the knowledge necessary
for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation of His will. They are the
standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God’s acts in
history. (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.)</p><a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled">https://szu.adventist.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/28_Beliefs.pdf</a>
